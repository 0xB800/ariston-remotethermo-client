  [![NPM Version][npm-image]][npm-url]
  [![NPM Downloads][downloads-image]][downloads-url]
  
  
This package provides a client for [Ariston remotethermo panel](https://www.ariston-net.remotethermo.com) (Ariston Net, Ariston Bus BridgenetÂ® control website).

Is uses WEB Api to control Ariston Heaters.
I'm only tested it with my Ariston Genus One Net boiler, but it should work with any boiler which uses Cube Net S or Sensys Thermostat.
Perhaps it also should work with similar Ariston like boilers/heaters like Chaffeatux etc.

## Limitations
There is a few limitation due to problems with connecting to Ariston RemoteThermo API. Sending many requests at the same time causes a Cube Net S disconnetion. It that case you will need to wait few seconds to Cube Net S reconnect with RemoteThermo servers (or it need somethimes to restart).
Library uses a requestretry under the hood, but it only solves a few problems.
